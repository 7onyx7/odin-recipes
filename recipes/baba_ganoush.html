    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Roasted Eggplant Dip is known as Baba Ganoush in the Middle East and
      as Melitzanosalata in Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to hummus, this roasted eggplant dip is a perfect blend of smokey
      eggplant, freshly squeezed lemon juice, plenty of garlic, tahini, and
      olive oil.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. large eggplant</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (divided)</li>
      <li>1½ tablespoon olive oil (divided)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame seed oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>3 tablespoon tahini paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cumin (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon toasted pine nuts</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper or paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice large eggplant in half. Sprinkle with ¼ tsp. salt. Place in a
        colander, flesh-side down and allow eggplant to sweat out the bitter
        juices for approximately 30 minutes. Rinse the salt off, they dry off
        with paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 Degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Smear ½ teaspoon of olive on a foil-lined pan. Place eggplant flesh-side
        down on the pan. Add unpeeled garlic cloves. Pour 1 teaspoon olive oil
        over them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pan in the oven. After 15 minutes, remove the garlic, and flip the
        eggplant over to the other side and cook an additional 15 minutes, or
        until slightly charred.
      </li>
      <li>
        When cool enough to handle, scrape the eggplant flesh away from the skin
        using a large spoon. Drain in a colander for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add the remaining salt, sesame seed oil, peeled and crushed
        garlic, tahini paste, lemon juice, and cumin (if using) to a food
        processor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggplant flesh to the food processor, along with the other
        ingredients. Pulse a few times, to mix. Do not over-mix, baba ghanoush
        should have a chunky consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plate the baba ghanoush and refrigerate until ready to serve. Before
        serving, drizzle with the remaining 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. Garnish
        with any of the following: chopped parsley, paprika/cayenne pepper, and
        toasted pine nuts.
      </li>
    </ol>
